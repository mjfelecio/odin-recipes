          <li>2 cups diced cooked chicken breast meat</li>
          <li>1 small head cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
          <li>4 carrots, thinly sliced</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
          <li>
            Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are
            cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with
            paprika, salt, and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).
          </li>
          <li>
            Place rice noodles in a large bowl; cover with warm water and let soften
            for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-low heat. Add
            onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is tender, about 3 to 5
            minutes. Stir in chicken, cabbage, carrots, and soy sauce. Cook until
            cabbage begins to soften.
          </li>
          <li>
            Toss in noodles and cook, stirring constantly, until heated through.
          </li>
          <li>Transfer pancit to a serving dish and garnish with lemon wedges.</li>
        </ol>

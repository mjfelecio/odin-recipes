    <h2 class="center">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package dried rice noodles</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely diced</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 cups diced cooked chicken breast meat</li>
      <li>1 small head cabbage, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>4 carrot, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup soy sauce</li>

      <li>2 lemons - cut into wedges, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="center">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are
        cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with
        paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place rice noodles in a large bowl; cover with warm water and let soften
        for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-low heat. Add
        onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is tender, about 3 to 5
        minutes. Stir in chicken, cabbage, carrots, and soy sauce. Cook until
        cabbage begins to soften.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss in noodles and cook, stirring constantly, until heated through.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer pancit to a serving dish and garnish with lemon wedges.</li>
